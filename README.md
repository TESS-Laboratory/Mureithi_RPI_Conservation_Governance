# Mureithi_RPI_Conservation_Governance

The aim of this project is to assess the extent to which RPI can quantify human 
impacts on rangeland vegetation productivity and understand how governance 
structures and local community engagement influence rangeland health outcomes. 
The specific research questions addressed are:  
1. Does RPI reflect the impacts of governance frameworks and interventions on 
rangeland condition in Kenya?  
2. How can these insights from RPI be used to inform the design and evaluation 
of adaptive management strategies that support Land Degradation Neutrality?
